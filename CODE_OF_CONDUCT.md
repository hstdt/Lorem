# Code of Conduct

To be a truly great community, we need to welcome developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code.

To give clarity of what is expected of our contributors, we feel conduct defined by contributor-covenant.org best articulates our values as well.
